(access-hive)=
```{dropdown} **ACCESS-HIVE Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator portal**
[ACCESS-Hive](https://access-hive.org.au/) is a portal to all documentation relevant to the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator, ACCESS, and the wider ACCESS community. ACCESS-Hive is developed for and by the [ACCESS NRI](access-nri) community following an open-source development model.

ACCESS-Hive is part of an effort to design higher quality and more accessible documentation for ACCESS and its community. Providing a single access point to any relevant documentation improves the accessibility and visibility of the documentation. As a portal, ACCESS-Hive provides links to documentation hosted on other sites. It is not intended to host the documentation itself.

ACCESS-Hive includes a [forum functionality](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/), a place for the ACCESS Community to come together, share information, have fruitful discussions, organise and plan shared activities.
