# NCI project management guidelines
...

## Project Representative
A project representative is either the Lead Chief Investigator listed on the project application, or their delegate in charge of resource management.

Resource allocation at NCI happens quarterly, however within the Centre we try and balance resource usage between our projects more frequently.

Project representatives are responsible for:

* Estimating quarterly SU requirements in collaboration with all project members, to ensure that there are available resources for all members
* Communicating with CMS the project's SU and storage requirements, so that resource usage can be balanced across the centre
* Reading and replying (when necessary) to usage update emails sent by CMS
* Reviewing project membership regularly

You will have lower priority for access to Centre’s resources if there are underused resources in other projects you have access to.

## Project Members
All members of a NCI project have requirements for using Centre resources. Resources are shared by all members of the project, please make sure that other members are able to do their work.

### General expectations
* Everyone is responsible for communicating their compute time requirements to their project representative before the start of each quarter.
* Everyone is responsible to know their projects CIs (https://my.nci.org.au) and how their project is organised (who does what). Write an email to your project Lead CI if you don’t know.
* Everyone is responsible to plan their usage in compute time and storage.
Keep your contact details up to date on https://my.nci.org.au, even after leaving the Centre if you still need access - we will use these details when contacting project members.
* Before leaving the Centre you need to tidy up your space following the best practices guides (this will be handled as part of the Centre exit process). 

###Data Resources
The ARC requires the Centre to abide to the Open Access policy. Existing CMS policies already comply with Open Access requirements for publishing data. Guidelines are online.
* Everyone is encouraged to fill in a data management plan to better keep track of your data and storage requirements.
* Everyone is responsible to know the best practices for each file system at NCI. Please ensure any data in group spaces (/scratch, /g/data, massdata) are readable by your group:
/home link https://opus.nci.org.au/display/Help/Files+and+Filesystems#FilesandFilesystems-/home 
/g/data 
Massdata link https://opus.nci.org.au/display/Help/Files+and+Filesystems#FilesandFilesystems-massdata 
/scratch link
* Check the central data store (data wiki page, NCI data catalogue, Python conda install, modules) and request your data or software package centrally if not already there. Do not download / install yourself before asking for central resources, we want to avoid duplicating data as much as possible

### Compute Resources
* Large simulations should be approved by the Lead CI. Large is more than 50% of the usual quarterly time allocation for the project
* Very large simulations should be approved by the Research Program. Very large is more than 100% of the usual quarterly time allocation for the project (i.e. will cover multiple quarters)

## CMS Team role
The CMS team is here to provide support in managing project resources. We will:

* Send frequent usage updates to project representatives
* Maintain the Grafana based analystics tool to monitor SU and storage usage 
* Provide resource usage estimates for commonly used model configurations
* Liaise with NCI to set quarterly compute resources, and modify resources within quarters if required
* Give generic and specific advice to users in managing their resources
