You can book a 30 minutes video call with one CMS member.

## To book a call
Please go to https://coecms.appointlet.com. At the end of the booking, a calendar event will be attached to the confirmation email. This event contains the link to the video call. You will also receive reminders of your bookings 24 hours and 15 minutes before the meeting time. 

You do not need to email us to notify us of the booking. We will be notified automatically. All emails you receive should allow you to reschedule or cancel your bookings if required, you do not need to contact us separately via email for cancelling or rescheduling.

## To prepare for the meeting
Unless you book at short notice (absolutely fine to do), please send an email to cws_help@nci.org.au before the meeting. Simply put the details of the meeting in the subject line, e.g.:
"Paola one-on-one, Tuesday 3/11, 10am".

In the email body, give us a short idea of what topic you will want to discuss. If your problem is better explained with an image, don't forget to attach it. Give us also any paths and locations to the material needed. This email is to ensure most of the time of the meeting can be spent solving your problem.

## Troubleshooting
If you have any problem (e.g. booking a call, accessing a call...) or any feedback, please send an email to cws_help@nci.org.au.
