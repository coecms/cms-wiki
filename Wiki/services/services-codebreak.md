# Codebreak

## Introduction

The CMS team is running CodeBreak sessions every week.

These sessions are an opportunity to come and have your questions answered by the CMS team, or to listen in to learn something new. Queries can be on some specific code you are writing, about a training you are trying to understand or broader questions about programming or scientific modelling.

At the start of each session, we will ask you to provide a brief summary of your query so we can organise break-out rooms themed on topics, in order to make it possible to cover as many questions as possible and keep each room focussed on related problems. 

When appropriate we will take a few minutes at the beginning of a session to present a special topic which can include useful new software or language features, interesting blogs or highlight new developments in modelling. These topics will be announced beforehand as they arise.

Please join the `training-coe` mailing list to receive a weekly reminder for these sessions and info on what the special topic of the week is. If you would like to suggest a topic for us to cover (e.g. How do I use Git branches) please send an email to cws_help@nci.org.au and we will try to cover it in a future session.
