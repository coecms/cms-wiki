# Working on Gadi

## Opening a NCI account
 [NCI docs](https://opus.nci.org.au/display/Help/Access)
 

## Setting up your working environment

Attend a NCI introduction training, there is one every month, see their [training calendar](https://opus.nci.org.au/display/Help/NCI+Training+and+Educational+Events)

 * mostly covered by NCI docs, we need to cover extra tips and anything which is CLEX relevant

### Projects and allocations
  
  * Joining
  * project etiquette (including estimating your potential usage)
  * monitoring resources usage (grafana etc) point to storage blog too!
  * merit allocation scheme (point to estimate training)
  * list of CLEX projects

````{dropdown} Pre - 2022 CLEX projects
In 2021 the computational CLEX projects were re-organised from the six orignal ones to four. As occasionally there is reference to the odler projects and they still have tape allocations, we listed all of them here.

```{list-table}

```{note} 
w35 has been merged into w97

w48 has been merged into w40
```

```{admonition} Which project should I join if I am part of several RPs?
:class: tip
We recommend people join all relevant projects but choose one project to work from. This will help people to collaborate with researchers from all the RPs they are part of.
